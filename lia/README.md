# LIA

Throughout this semester, you will work in teams of two to redesign a
website of your choice. Every two weeks, you will present your progress
in class for a formal review. Each review will focus on the material
covered in class during the previous weeks. You will find the
deliverables for each review in their respective folder. Deliverables
must be submitted before class.
