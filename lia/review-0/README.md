First thing you need to do before next class is to choose your teammate
as well as the website you both wish to redesign. You also need to
choose five pages you want to focus on. For instance, if I was to choose
to redesign the [Hacker News][] website, I might focus on the
[homepage][], the [comments page][], the [guidelines page][], the [login
page][], and the [submit page][]. The pages' layout should be
sufficiently different from one another, and at least one of them need
to include a form.

All deliverables for the LIA must be submitted in a single Figma design
file. You will need to share a link to that file with me before next
class, either via Mio or Teams. At this point, the layout of the
document does not matter, but going forward its organization will be
assessed. Deliverables should be in separate pages, and clearly
identified.
