## Steps & deliverables

The deliverables below should be presented during the review as a slide
deck using Figma's built-in slide frames.

1.  Write a few sentences describing the core values of the website's
    new visual language. These values should guide your stylistic
    choices. Make sure they are related to the content of your website,
    and avoid generalities ("modern", "accessible", "simple", etc.).

2.  Choose a base unit in pixels to be used throughout your website. All
    spacing will be based on multiples of this unit.

3.  Design a grid system to lay out your website's content. Make sure it
    works well with devices of different sizes, and that it uses your
    base unit. Apply the grid to your wireframes using Figma's layout
    grid, making sure elements are aligned properly.

4.  Choose two typefaces to be used throughout your website. Write a few
    sentences to justify your choice. Make sure to refer to the core
    values of your visual language.

5.  Design a type scale that includes size, leading, margins, and font
    for body text, small text, and three levels of headings. The scale
    should be implemented in Figma using styles.
