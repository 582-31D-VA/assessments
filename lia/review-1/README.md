To design a good user experience, we must first identify the website's
goals as well as its users. It's also common to survey similar websites
in order to identify commonalities. Only after that information has been
gathered can we start wireframing.

## Steps & deliverables

The deliverables below should be submitted as a slide deck using Figma's
built-in slide frames.

1.  Write a few sentences describing the website's user base. Who uses
    the website? Why do they use it? What device do they use? Which
    countries are they from? Which languages do they speak? How familiar
    are they with web interfaces in general?

2.  Identify your design goals. Name one main goal for the website, and
    one goal per page. Consider user needs, and what actions you want
    them to take to achieve them.

3.  Choose two websites similar to the one you are designing. For each,
    identify the sequence through which users are expected to flow
    through the interface. Pay attention to the placement and size of
    elements.

4.  Create a storyboard. Write or sketch the steps you wish people to
    take when using your website. Make sure the user flow corresponds to
    the design goals.

5.  Design the wireframes. For each page, make one wireframe for mobile,
    and one wireframe for desktop.
