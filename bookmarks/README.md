The best way to learn about web design is to analyse existing websites,
and question their decisions related to user interface and user
experience. Why did the designers pick theses typefaces? Why are these
elements placed at the top? Why are these buttons grouped together? Et
cetera. To goal of this assignment is to encourage you to ask these
questions.

Each week, you will choose a website whose design you find noteworthy
for one reason or another. You will then share your choice and your
reasoning with the rest of the class on [Are.na](https://www.are.na).
